    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made by layering wide, flat pasta sheets with various fillings, often including a combination of meat, cheese, and sauce. The layers typically alternate between a hearty meat sauce, often made from ground beef or sausage in a tomato-based sauce, and a creamy cheese mixture, usually featuring ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan. Some versions include vegetables like spinach or mushrooms.

    The dish is then baked in the oven, allowing the flavors to meld together, and the cheese to melt and form a golden, bubbly crust. Lasagna is rich, flavorful, and often served as a hearty main course.
