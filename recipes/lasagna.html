    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made by layering wide, flat pasta sheets with various fillings, often including a combination of meat, cheese, and sauce. The layers typically alternate between a hearty meat sauce, often made from ground beef or sausage in a tomato-based sauce, and a creamy cheese mixture, usually featuring ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan. Some versions include vegetables like spinach or mushrooms.
    </p>
    <p>
        The dish is then baked in the oven, allowing the flavors to meld together, and the cheese to melt and form a golden, bubbly crust. Lasagna is rich, flavorful, and often served as a hearty main course.
