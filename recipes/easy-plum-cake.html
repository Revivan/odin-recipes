    <p>
        Whether you're new to meal prepping or an old pro, making and freezing breakfast burritos ahead is a no-brainer—and the best way to get everyone excited to get out of bed on those brisk fall mornings. Follow the recipe as-is, with egg, sausage, tomato, cilantro, jalapeños, and taco seasoning, or customize to your liking.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 Large Eggs</li>
        <li>2/3 cup milk</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>        
        <li>1 pound bulk pork sausage</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
        <li>Whisk together eggs, milk and salt in a large bowl. Heat butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Pour in egg mixture; cook and stir until eggs are completely set, about 5 minutes</li>
        <li>Break up cooked eggs into small pieces and place into a large bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat the same large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir sausage and garlic in the hot skillet for 5 minutes. Add onion, continue to cook and stir until sausage is crumbly, even browned, and no longer pink. Drain and discard any excess grease.</li>
        <li>Transfer sausage to eggs in the bowl. Stir in tomato, cilantro, jalapeños, and taco seasoning until well combined. Allow mixture to cool to room temperature, then stir in cheddar cheese.</li>
        <li>Lay a tortilla on your work surface, then spoon some of the egg filling halfway between the bottom edge and the centre of the tortilla. Flatten filling into a rectangular shape with the back of a spoon. Fold the bottom of tortilla snugly over filling, then fold the left and right edges. Roll burrito up to the top edge, forming a tight cylinder. Repeat with remaining ingredients.</li>
        <li>Wrap individual burritos tightly with plastic wrap and store in the freezer until ready to serve.</li>
        <li>To serve, heat burritos in the microwave until hot, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
